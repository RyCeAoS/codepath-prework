## Reflection Questions
1. If you used any outside resources to help complete your submission (websites, books, people, etc) list them here. 
[None other than the prework site]


2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words) 
[One challenge I have encountered in creating this submission would be creating the buttons and having the background light up and coordinate to my javascript code. While trying to make my 4 buttons light up and coordinate with the sound, I have found it difficult to have the buttons light up when I needed them to after I pressed them. They seemed like they didn't want to glow up and it took me a while to figure out why. Along with this, organizing the functions within javascript was difficut since I wasn't able to get the order right for some of them which gave me some error. One way I overcame this challenge was through analyzing the code in chunks. I first began in debugging the codeand see where JS file was wrong. The functions in the javascript file seemed to be the sissue for me so I looked there. The 1st step I have was checking that I have inserted all the correct code that was given from the codepath prework to ensure that I have copied and pasted the correct functions with my own additional details. Finally, with these two steps involved I have figured out the steps needed to be done to fix my code, in which I have forgotten to add the turn on function for the button]

3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? (recommended 100 - 300 words) 


[Something I would like to ask is to what extent can I use web development for my future? As someone who is studying cyber security it is quite important to know how to do some code in different languages so that way I can assess different vulnerabilities. Also something that I would like to know is how some services can be implemented using web development. What features do I need to put in so that way I can have a successful website for clients? Also which bots I have to include in the website. These are questions I would like answers to.]

4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
[If I had some time I would have loved to really get a better grasp on the programming languages involved in this project. As someone who is relatively new to css, javascript, and html it would have been a treat to really study these languages in depth so that way I can have them under my repertoire. Alongside that I may have wanted to incorporate more buttons and a faster speed to make the game even more challenging for the user. Everyone loves a challenge and I feel like with more time I would have been able to provide that experience.]
