## Reflection Questions
1. If you used any outside resources to help complete your submission (websites, books, people, etc) list them here. 
[-No outside resources were used other than the prework website]

2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words) 

[One of the most challenging parts of the submission was definitely the syntax errors that came along in creating the application. It was quite troublesome trying to get some features to get working considering the vast amount of lines of code that was written in order for the game to be working in full order. When reviewing code you had to really analyze where things may have gone wrong and pay attention to any syntax that may seem off. When looking for said errors, I came alongside some interesting errors in terms of spacing of certain commands for the button actions. I really had to look closely just to see where I can either add or omit spaces so I can get the code to work. Another thing that really gave me some trouble was being able to organize the functions in the javascript portion of the code just so the game can even run properly and be somewhat functional. I often found certain functions out of line with other functions causing some major errors in the code that wouldnâ€™t even allow the guessing feature to work on the website. Despite these difficulties I was able to manage to get the program to work.]

3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? (recommended 100 - 300 words) 

[I guess some questions I would have would be to what extent can I use web development? Can I use it for web hacking or managing databases? I know that certain companies have online platforms in order to have their services be automated and be very smooth for their clients. Hopefully I will be able to see that during my time in the internship and be able to really flesh out my skills in that field. Another question I had was concerning how certain bots can be added to websites to assist in the automation in websites. How are they implemented? And in what way can they be used for services such as penetration testing?. These are some questions that I have.]

4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. (recommended 100 - 300 words) 

[If I had more time, I would spend more time being able to add more additional features. There were some things in the codepath optional features that I would like to be implemented. Another thing that I would like to do is really understand the syntax of the code so that way I can be able to really have it under my repertoire of abilities for web development. It would really advance my career in web development and web app development. This project overall was a very good learning experience for me and I would have liked to spend more time and being able to really learn more about the code.]
